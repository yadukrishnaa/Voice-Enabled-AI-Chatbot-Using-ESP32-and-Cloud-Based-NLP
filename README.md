# Voice-Enabled-AI-Chatbot-Using-ESP32-and-Cloud-Based-NLP
Project Introduction
This project implements a real-time, voice-interactive chatbot system using dual ESP32 microcontrollers, designed to provide a smooth, natural conversational experience with visual feedback. The system supports push-to-talk voice input, speech-to-text processing, AI chatbot interaction, and text-to-speech audio output, accompanied by animated OLED expressions for better user engagement.

To overcome the resource limitations of a single microcontroller, the system is divided into two dedicated modules:

ESP32-A handles voice recording, speech recognition, and chatbot communication.

ESP32-B manages text-to-speech audio playback and OLED display animations.
